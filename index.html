		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p>In the land of Arcania there exists an Yggdrasil Tree, which is said to be the reason there is peace in the world. According to legend, those who reach the top of the tree will have any dream come true. Each of the land's four races have their own legend regarding what the top of the tree holds, but nobody has ever seen it. Those who wish to challenge the Yggdrasil labyrinth and reach the top visit the city of Iorys, a city near the base of the tree, where they become official adventurers and are able to explore the labyrinth</p>

		<h3>Gameplay</h3>
		<p>The game is set on the new continent of Arcania, which has its own Yggdrasil Tree. There are four races inhabiting the continent: Earthlain (human), Celestrians (elves), Therians (beast-like humans), and Brounies (dwarves/hobbits), each one being able to take on different classes when creating party members.In addition, the player will be able to change their chraracters' hair, skin, and eye colour (for each eye separately), and all party members now feature partial (and customizable) voice acting, which was previously exclusive to Story Mode parties in the Untold remakes.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="Classes">
		<h3>Classes</h3>
		<p>Etrian Odyssey V features ten classes, each one being exclusive to a certain race from the start; however, players will eventually gain the ability to reclass a character regardless of race, keeping their portrait and basic stat spread. The Earthlain have access to four classes, while the others have two to choose from. Rather than the subclassing system of past games, the Legendary Title system is used. By mastering a specific class, the player can give their character one of two Legendary Titles available for that class, allowing that character to learn new skills and giving them unique characteristics depending on the title (including an altered stat growth).</p>
